## short description

When looking for boundries you can group things that make money and things that don't make money but provide some value to the user.

### example

google has a search engine, but makes money out of ads. They don't get money from their users, but from selling ads.

## context

Use these at a strategic level when defining bounded context. When you want to seperate core domains from supporting and generic subdomains
